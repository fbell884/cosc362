\begin{document}
\maketitle

To start off this assignment, I first created a repository on GitHub titled "cosc362."

On my personal linux machine, I used the git command: 

	git clone https://github.com/fbell884/cosc362.git

This then brought a folder into my git repository. I went into savage and did the same thing.

I then switched back to my personal machine and created a LaTeX document as a test (text1.tex). 
	
	vim test1.tex

	*editing file*

	pdflatex test1.tex

Next, I used git commands to add, commit and push my changes to the remore repository:

	git add test1.pdf
	
	git commit -m "Test Commit" 

	git push origin master

After this, I verified on GitHub that the file was there. Now I went back into savage to pull the changes: 

	cd cosc362

	git pull origin master

The "test1.pdf" file was now on the savage server in the local git repository. 

Now that I verified that this works, I have created a new LaTeX document to document my process. I am currently editing this and then I will repeat the steps above to pull this document from savage onto my personal linux machine:

	vim gitassignment1.tex

	*editing file*

	pdflatex gitassignment1.tex

	git add gitassignment1.pdf

	git commit -m "Committing First Git Assignment"

	git push origin master

*Switching back to Personal Machine*

	cd cosc362

	git pull origin master

Now the file for the assignment that I am working on right now in savage, is now pulled on to my personal machine.
